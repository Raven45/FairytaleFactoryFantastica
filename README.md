FairytaleFactoryFantastica
==========================
An implementation of Pentago in Qt 5.2. See ImplementationSummary.pdf for details (a document geared toward future students of this course).

Due to unbridled abuse of embedded resources, expect to spend at least 5 minutes compiling the first time.

Only 1440 x 900 screen resolution is supported.

Developed primarily with the MinGW 4.8.2 compiler. Development was also done using Clang (not sure which version). An installer was only written for Windows (NSIS), but dev builds were working on OSX.
